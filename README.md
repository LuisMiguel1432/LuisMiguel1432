# 💫 About Me:
Hello! I'm Luis Miguel, a junior developer taking my first steps into the professional world, highly motivated to learn and grow within the software development sector.

I discovered my interest in programming during my studies, when I realized how fascinating it is to create real solutions through code. Throughout my training, I’ve become familiar with technologies and languages such as Java, C#, HTML, CSS, Blazor, ASP.NET, and Angular, gaining a solid foundation to begin my career as a developer.

I am currently looking for an opportunity where I can apply my knowledge, work as part of a team, and continue developing both my technical and personal skills. I consider myself a committed person with a proactive attitude and a strong desire to keep learning continuously.

My goal is to join a team that allows me to continue growing professionally, learn from experienced people, and, in the medium term, specialize in key areas of development to provide real value to the projects I participate in.
